# Code Execution

NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit supports Python code execution in a remote sandbox environment through the
`code_execution` function. This function sends Python code to a remote code execution server and returns the result,
status, and any errors.

## Usage

Code execution requires a running [Piston server](https://github.com/engineer-man/piston). Follow the Piston setup
instructions or connect to an existing server, then configure the function with the API URL of the server.

The config object for the `code_execution` function is shown below:
```python
class CodeExecutionToolConfig(FunctionBaseConfig, name="code_execution"):
    """
    Tool for executing python code in a remotely hosted sandbox environment.
    """
    uri: HttpUrl = Field(default="http://127.0.0.1:6000", description="URI for the code execution sandbox server")
    sandbox_type: str = Field(default="piston", description="The type of code execution sandbox")
    timeout: float = Field(default=10.0, description="Number of seconds to wait for a code execution request")
    max_output_characters: int = Field(default=1000, description="Maximum number of characters that can be returned")
```
By default, the function uses the Piston client, waits up to 10 seconds, and returns at most 1000 characters. Configure
`uri` for the Piston server before running the workflow:
```yaml
functions:
    code_execution_tool:
      _type: code_execution
      uri: "http://my-piston-server/api/v2/"
```

Below is an example config that connects to a Piston server with a timeout of 30s and a maximum of 3000 characters returned:
```yaml
functions:
    code_execution_tool:
      _type: code_execution
      uri: "http://my-piston-server/api/v2/"
      timeout: 30
      max_output_characters: 3000
```

This remote code execution servers return JSON object containing the execution status, `stdout`, and `stderr`. For example:

```json
{
    "process_status": "completed",
    "stdout": "Hello World\n\n",
    "stderr": ""
}
```
If code execution results in an error, this will show up in `stderr`:
```json
{
    "process_status": "error",
    "stdout": "",
    "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 19, in <module>\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n\n"
}
```
Lastly, it is worth noting that the only thing returned to the function calling the `code_execution` function is (assuming no errors) whatever is printed out to `stdout`. No other artifacts, such as files or in memory objects, are returned from the sandbox, so it is important that the desired result of the code execution is printed out.
