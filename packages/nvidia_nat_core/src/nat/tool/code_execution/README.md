# Code Execution Sandbox

A secure, containerized Python code execution environment that allows safe execution of Python code with comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities.

## Overview

The Code Execution Sandbox provides:
- **Isolated code execution** in isolated Docker containers
- **Multiple input formats** including raw code, dictionary format, and markdown
- **Dependency management** with pre-installed libraries
- **Flexible configuration** with customizable timeouts and output limits
- **Robust debugging** with extensive logging and error reporting

## Quick Start

The local sandbox requires Docker 28 or later. Follow the [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) to install a supported version, and start Docker before continuing.

### Step 1: Start the Sandbox Server

Navigate to the local sandbox directory and start the server:

```bash
cd packages/nvidia_nat_core/src/nat/tool/code_execution/local_sandbox
docker compose up
```

Docker Compose will:
- Start the sandbox server on port 6000
- Start an nginx proxy, allowing the sandbox to be isolated
- Mount your working directory for file operations

#### Advanced Usage:
```bash
# Custom image name
SANDBOX_NAME=my-sandbox docker compose up

# Custom output directory
OUTPUT_DATA_PATH=/path/to/output docker compose up

# Using environment variable
export OUTPUT_DATA_PATH=/path/to/output
docker compose up
```

### Step 2: Test the Installation

Run the comprehensive test suite to verify everything is working:

```bash
cd packages/nvidia_nat_core/src/nat/tool/code_execution
pytest test_code_execution_sandbox.py
```

Note: a running instance of a local sandbox is required.

## Using the Code Execution Tool

### Basic Usage

The sandbox accepts HTTP POST requests to `http://localhost:6000/execute` with JSON payloads:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "generated_code": "print(\"Hello, World!\")",
    "timeout": 30,
    "language": "python"
  }' \
  http://localhost:6000/execute
```

### Supported Input Formats

#### 1. Raw Python Code
```json
{
  "generated_code": "import numpy as np\nprint(np.array([1, 2, 3]))",
  "timeout": 30,
  "language": "python"
}
```

#### 2. Dictionary Format
```json
{
  "generated_code": "{'generated_code': 'print(\"Hello from dict format\")'}",
  "timeout": 30,
  "language": "python"
}
```

#### 3. Markdown Code Blocks
```json
{
  "generated_code": "```python\nprint('Hello from markdown')\n```",
  "timeout": 30,
  "language": "python"
}
```

### Response Format

The sandbox returns JSON responses with the following structure:

```json
{
  "process_status": "completed|error|timeout",
  "stdout": "Standard output content",
  "stderr": "Standard error content"
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Sandbox Configuration

- **URI**: Default `http://127.0.0.1:6000`
- **Timeout**: Default 10 seconds (configurable)
- **Max Output Characters**: Default 1000 characters
- **Memory Limit**: 10GB (configurable in Docker)
- **Working Directory**: Mounted volume for file operations

### Environment Variables

- `OUTPUT_DATA_PATH`: Custom path for file operations
- `SANDBOX_HOST`: Custom sandbox host
- `SANDBOX_PORT`: Custom sandbox port

## Security Considerations

- **Isolated execution**: All code runs in Docker containers
- **Network isolation**: Containers have limited network access
- **File system isolation**: Mounted volumes provide controlled file access
- **Process isolation**: Each execution runs in a separate process

The included `docker-compose.yaml` file sets up the sandbox server behind an nginx proxy, this is intended to be used for local development and testing. For production deployments, consider additional security measures such as resource limits,authentication, authorization, and network policies.

Although Docker containers provide a level of isolation, executing untrusted code in a container still carries risk. Refer to the [Docker Engine security documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/) for more information.
